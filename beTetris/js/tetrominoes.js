// Here we are simply defining all the tetrominoes pieces as we have defnied them in our README tutorial,
// the idea is to create an object which contain all the possible rotation of the pice represented as 1 and 0
// As you can see all these elements are basically arrays of arrays of arrays. The sense here is that in general an array
// is a simple way to organize an object with pre-defined sub parts. Every piece is defined as a constant to make it perform
// a little better then the let variable declaration, and also, it is used as a reminder that we don't want to change these
// properties anymore; they are read-only.
